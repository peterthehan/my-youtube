# Description

The extension scrapes the page for each video's progress bar and text data to filter on and apply the darken styling.

Open `content.js` to modify the substring blacklist to your liking.

# Installation

1. Download and extract [Darken](https://github.com/peterthehan/darken/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions` from your address bar.
3. Enable `Developer mode` located in the top-right corner.
4. Drag-and-drop the extracted folder into the Extensions page.

Happy Darkening! ðŸŽ‰
